        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>A girl who was highly celebrated by her father—though she never quite knew why—always showcased as his golden child, whether for her talent or mischievous school stories. I credit him entirely for instilling in me an ambitious and relentless drive. What once seemed like a simple dream of a walk-in closet has transformed into an insatiable ambition to lead across multiple domains, leave a mark in leadership, and become the first name associated with product success. My journey has been a non-stop sprint toward every milestone, and I am determined to become a Creative Director and CEO shortly.</p>
